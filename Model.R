#check VIF
# In regression, "multicollinearity" refers to predictors that are correlated with other predictors.  Multicollinearity occurs when your model includes multiple factors that are correlated not just to your response variable, but also to each other. In other words, it results when you have factors that are a bit redundant.
# Variance inflation factor (VIF) is used to detect the severity of multicollinearity in the ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis.)
#If the VIF is equal to 1 there is no multicollinearity among factors
#If the VIF is greater than 1, the predictors may be moderately correlated.
#A VIF between 5 and 10 indicates high correlation that may be problematic. And if the VIF goes above 10, you can assume that the regression coefficients are poorly estimated due to multicollinearity.
